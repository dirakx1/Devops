# Intro

DevOps is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration, integration, automation, and measurement of cooperation between software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals and operation.

* Continuous integration (CI) is a software engineering practice in which isolated changes are immediately tested and reported on when they are added to a larger code base

* Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development discipline where software is built in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.

* Continuous Deployment (CD) is an extension to delivery extending deployment of new SW release into a existing network.
